## Running batch DF classifier
* For algorithmic details, please look into our paper **J. R. Foulds, R. Islam, K. Keya, and S. Pan. An Intersectional Definition of Fairness. 36th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), 2020. [Arxiv long version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08362.pdf).**
* Typical classifier: it is typical DNN-based classifier without any fairness interventions. Run the code using "run_batch_typical_clf.py" file. First, the model will be trained. Then the model will be evaluated on the dev and test set. Finally, the evalaution results will be generated in the following file: "batch_typical_clf_out.txt".
* Batch DF classifier: it is our DF penalty-based DNN classifier for batch method. Run the code using "run_Batch_DF_Classifier.py" file. First, the model will be trained. Then the model will be evaluated on the dev and test set. Finally, the evalaution results will be generated in the following file: "batch_DF_EPS0.txt".
