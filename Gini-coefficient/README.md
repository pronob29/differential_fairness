##  Inequity of Intersectional Fairness Measures
* We quantify the resulting inequity of fairness metric using the Gini coefficient(Lorenz, 1905), a commonly used measure of statistical dispersion which is often used to represent the inequity of income. For details, please look into our paper: **R. Islam, K.N. Keya, S. Pan, A.D. Sarwate, and J.R. Foulds. Differential fairness. Under submission, 2021.** 
* To calculate the Gini coefficient G of DF and SF metrics, run the following code: "compute_Gini_indx.py". The code will compute G of DF and SF metrics for data and a logistic regression model, which will be generated in the following output file: "Adult_Gini_index.txt".
* For a fixed algorithm and data distribution, a fairness metric with a smaller Gini coefficient distributes its (un)fairness consideration more equitably across the population, which is typically desirable in the sense that the entire population has a voice in the determination of (un)fairness.
