## Running stochastic DF classifier
* We develop stochastic DF classifier in our paper **R. Islam, K.N. Keya, S. Pan, A.D. Sarwate, and J.R. Foulds. Differential fairness. Under submission, 2021.** It a practical and scalable learning algorithm that enforces our DF criteria using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, while addressing data sparsity problem of intersectional fairness estimation arised in SGD minibatches.
* Stochastic Typical classifier: it is typical DNN-based classifier for stochastic method without any fairness interventions. Run the code using "run_stochastic_typical_clf.py" file. First, the model will be trained. Then the model will be evaluated on the dev and test set. Finally, the evalaution results will be generated in the following file: "stochastic_typical_clf_out.txt".
* Stochastic DF classifier: it is our DF penalty-based DNN classifier for stochastic method. Run the code using "run_Stochastic_DF_Classifier.py" file. First, the model will be trained (it may take a while). Then the model will be evaluated on the dev and test set. Finally, the evalaution results will be generated in the following file: "stochastic_DF_EPS0.txt".
* The models are evaluated with respect to following performance metrics: Accuracy, AUC, F1 Score, and fairness metrics: DF (differential fairness), SF (subgroup fairness), p\%-Rule.
